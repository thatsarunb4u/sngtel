Hello there. Its a pleasure to work on the assignment.

I've created two projects.
1. AnimalKingdom - Java Project
2. animalkingdomweb - Springboot project for REST

All the key classes are inside AnimalKingdom java project. For your convenience, I've created ample comments in the code 
and I've created Main class for each of the solution items. Eg: SolutionAEvaluator.java etc. These solution classes can be found under
AnimalKindom/src/com/animalkingdom/solution/
There are also .md files under the same path explaining the rationale behind taking some design approach.

This is a completely working code. You can download the "AnimalKingdom" java project and import into eclipse as Java project.

Likewise, to test the RESTful webservice, please download the animalkingdomweb project and import into eclipse as a gradle project. 
AnimalkingdomwebApplication.java - to start the embedded server in the spring boot.

REST URLs:
http://localhost:8080/animal-kingdom-service/singRooster
http://localhost:8080/animal-kingdom-service/singInNativeRooster

Since there wasn't much time, I'd only created the above two services as a PoC.

For any queires, please reach out to me. 

Had a wonderful experience working on this assignment. Can't wait to explain things during the face-to-face interview. Thanks for the opportunity given.
